Odin Recipes
This project is a part of The Odin Project curriculum. It is a basic recipe website built using HTML to showcase my understanding of web development fundamentals.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a static website with a collection of recipes, which includes an index page and individual pages for each recipe. It helped me practice structuring web pages, linking pages, and organizing directories. The project also gave me hands-on experience working with Git, version control, and deploying a site on GitHub Pages.

Skills Demonstrated
HTML: Building a structure with headings, lists, links, and images.

Git & GitHub: Version control, committing changes, and publishing the site using GitHub Pages.

Project Organization: Creating folders and structuring HTML files logically for scalability.

Responsive Web Design (Basic): Ensuring that content is organized in a user-friendly way.

Project Breakdown
Iteration 1: Initial Structure
Created the base structure for the project.

Included an index.html with a basic homepage structure and headings.

Linked the index page to various recipe pages.

Iteration 2: Recipe Pages
Created individual recipe pages (Lasagna, Pizza Margherita, Pasta Carbonara, Brazilian BBQ).

Added recipe titles, ingredients, steps, and descriptions.

Included relevant images for each recipe, ensuring they load correctly in the browser.

Iteration 3: Image Handling and Layout
Resized images for consistency across recipe pages.

Ensured the images loaded properly across different browsers, fixing any issues with paths.

Iteration 4: GitHub Pages Deployment
Deployed the website on GitHub Pages, making it accessible to anyone on the web.

Ensured the website was live and easy to navigate.

Next Steps
Learning CSS: I am currently working on learning CSS to improve the design and layout of this website. I will be enhancing the UI with custom styles, including fonts, colors, and responsiveness.

JavaScript (Future): I plan to learn JavaScript to make the website more interactive, such as adding a dynamic recipe search or interactive recipe cards.

How to View the Website
